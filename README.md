# Customer-Financial-Behaviour-Project
**Introduction:**
In today’s digital world, data is the backbone of informed decision-making. For the financial sector, understanding customer behaviors and preferences is essential for maintaining a competitive edge and enhancing service quality. This article presents a comprehensive guide to a Power BI capstone project focused on banking data analysis. This project leverages Power BI’s capabilities to analyze customer demographics, banking behaviors, and loan information for XYZ Bank. By visualizing data, we can uncover trends and insights that drive data-backed decisions.
 
**Project Overview:**
The project uses a dataset containing essential customer information, including age, gender, job classification, marital status, account type, and loan details. The data also features geographic data, making it possible to explore customer distribution by state and country. Our objective is to uncover patterns and relationships across these fields to provide valuable insights for XYZ Bank.
 
**Objectives and Goals:**
The primary goals of this project are to analyze various aspects of customer banking behavior:
Age Distribution Analysis: Identify the most common age group among XYZ Bank customers.
Gender-Based Account Balance Comparison: Compare the average account balance across genders to detect any disparities.
Geographic Customer Distribution: Identify the states and countries with the highest customer counts and calculate their percentages.
Job Classification and Loan Uptake: Investigate the relationship between job classification and loan types.
Marital Status and Loan Analysis: Compare housing loan uptake among married and unmarried customers.
Popular Account Types: Identify the most common account types and their prevalence among customers.
Account Tenure vs. Balance Correlation: Assess if there’s a correlation between how long customers have been with the bank and their account balance.
 
**Required Skills and Prerequisites:**
To accomplish this project, proficiency in data analysis and Power BI tools is essential. The prerequisites include:
Data Analysis and Visualization: A strong foundation in data visualization and concepts like data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation.
Power BI Proficiency: Familiarity with Power BI tools, including Power Query, Power Pivot, and Power View.
Data Modeling and ETL: Experience with Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes to prepare data for analysis.
Collaboration: Ability to work effectively with stakeholders and communicate findings clearly.
 
**Project Steps:**
**Installation of Power BI Desktop:**
To begin, download Power BI Desktop from Microsoft’s website, selecting the appropriate version (32-bit or 64-bit) for your operating system. Once installed, launch Power BI to explore its capabilities for creating reports and dashboards.
Data Preparation and Cleaning
Data cleaning is performed using Power Query in Power BI, focusing on tasks such as:
Changing column data types to ensure compatibility with Power BI visuals.
Merging name fields and capitalizing text for uniformity.
Removing duplicates and blank rows for data accuracy.
Joining customer details with banking information using customer ID as the primary key.
Rounding balances to the nearest whole number for simplicity.
**3. Visualizations for Key Insights:**
Power BI’s visualization tools, such as pie charts, bar charts, and area charts, allow us to analyze and present data insights effectively. Key visualizations include:
Card Visuals: Display total customer count and overall account balance.
Pie and Donut Charts: Show balance distribution by account type and gender.
Stacked Bar Charts: Represent balance amounts by marital status.
Stacked Area Charts: Display job classification and state balance distribution.
Clustered Column Charts: Visualize customer distribution across age groups.
Using these visualizations, we can create an intuitive, accessible dashboard that provides valuable insights into customer demographics and behaviors.
**4. Data Insights and Analysis:**
With visual insights created, let’s analyze the data findings:
Customer Age and Gender Distribution: Card visuals and pie charts reveal common age groups and balance differences across genders, indicating potential areas for targeted services.
Geographic Patterns: Mapping states and countries with the highest customer counts helps identify the bank’s strongest markets, informing branch and service expansion strategies.
Account Preferences and Tenure Analysis: The balance by tenure helps us assess customer loyalty trends, potentially uncovering relationships between account longevity and balance levels.
Loan Preferences: Exploring job classification and loan types sheds light on loan product popularity, helping tailor future loan offers based on customer occupation and needs.
**5. Publishing and Sharing the Report:**
Finally, Power BI’s sharing capabilities enable easy publication and collaboration on the report. Sharing findings with stakeholders fosters data-driven discussions and aligns strategy with customer insights.
 
**Conclusion:**
This Power BI project offers a powerful glimpse into customer banking behavior, empowering XYZ Bank to make more informed decisions. By visualizing patterns in age, gender, geographic distribution, account types, and loan preferences, the bank gains actionable insights that contribute to customer satisfaction and growth.
For aspiring Power BI developers, this project exemplifies the impact of data visualization in solving real-world business problems. With foundational skills in Power BI and a structured approach, any developer can leverage data to support strategic decisions and customer insights, transforming raw data into a visual story that drives success.
